            Our Project Principles
          </h1>

          <p className="mt-5 text-base">
            Our projects adhere to these three principles:
            <br />
            <br />
            Beneficiaries are partners in our work: They design, implement and
            evaluate work according to their own needs, resources, and goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            We invest in young people because they are the future.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe that partnerships not only result in better outcomes but
            teach us to live together in a time of rapid change.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a membership organization, we keep our overhead to a minimum,
            spending less than 8% on administration.
            <br />
            <br />
            We use your donations for project work.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please contact us if you would like a copy of the annual accounts.
            <br />
            <br />
            And be patient if we donâ€™t respond right away. We might be out in
            the villages we care for so much.
